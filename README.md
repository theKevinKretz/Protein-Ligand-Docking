# Protein-Ligand-Docking: Bioinformatics against Malaria & Co.

Tropical diseases pose an extreme threat to the local population in the areas where they occur. Compared to their importance - malaria, for example, is one of the most common infectious diseases in the world, with 200 million cases per year - they receive little attention in the media, in the form of research projects and in the development departments of many pharmaceutical companies in unaffected industrialized countries.

Due to the publication of the AlphaFold2 paper in July 2021 and the simultaneously published database of three-dimensional protein models as well as the Galaxy Server of the University of Freiburg, we got good conditions to search for potential active agents against tropical diseases with the help of protein-ligand docking.
